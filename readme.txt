Code description.

The codes are split in two folders for their respective question. In both folders it contains an identical 'Huffman.c' which builds the Huffman tree, I have split it in this way so the codes can be accessed and reused separately if you only wished to use a certain bit. In both folders there is a specific makefile to compile the code.

1.1

In 1.1, it pairs the huffman binary tree with '1.1.c' which assigns 0 and 1 values to the tree nodes and works out the total number of bytes.

1.2

In 1.2, it prints out the Huffman binary tree.
